# PollinatorProjects



This repo documents a series of experiments with pollinator recording made as part of 
a remote residency at the EU Science Hub JRC Makerspace in Milan, Italy.

The three projects are:

- Augmented reality with pollinator recording

- Phone based camera traps for pollinators

- CO2 knock-out-pots for pollinators

See relevant pdf inside each folder to explain different project and how to setup.
